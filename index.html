				An <strong>Equinox</strong> is the instant of time when the
				plane of Earth's equator passes through the geometric center of
				the Sun's disk. In simpler terms, if you are at the equator, the
				sun in directly above, and the amount of daytime to night time
				is theoretically equal.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <strong>Solstice</strong> is an event that occurs when the Sun
				appears to reach its most northerly or southerly excursion
				relative to the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. In
				simpler terms, depending on which side of the equator, the day
				time will be longer portion of the day than nighttime in the
				Summer Solstice, and the nighttime will be longer than the
				daytime in the Winter Solstice.

				Seasons are an affect of the 23.5deg tilt of our rotation and
				with an understanding of these seasons, humans would create
				civilization.
